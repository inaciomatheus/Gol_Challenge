# Solutions

This challenge consists of two different parts.

##  First Task

The objective of the first part of this challenge represents a problem close to a real scenario where a broken frontend applcation needs to be fixed.

### Install API KEYS 

In the file backend/app.js, replace API_KEY  on line 7 and API_SECRET on line 8 by the values sent by e-mail:

                6 const amadeus = new Amadeus({
                7     clientId: API_KEY,
                8     clientSecret: API_SECRET,
                9 });

After that you will need to install the dependencies of the project following the intructcions bellow:

### 1 - Install NODE.js

### 2 - Run npm init -y

### 3 - Then install angular dependencies.

    3.1 - Express
    3.2 - Cors
    3.3 - Amadeus
    3.4 - Nodemon
    3.5 - Angular CLI

These dependecies can be installed by running the following commands in your terminal:

    npm install express amadeus cors nodemon
    npm install -g @angular/cli

After installing these dependencies navigate to */backend* folder and run:

    npm start

You will know that the backend api is running when the following message appears:

    [nodemon] 2.0.15
    [nodemon] to restart at any time, enter `rs`
    [nodemon] watching path(s): *.*
    [nodemon] watching extensions: js,mjs,json
    [nodemon] starting `node app.js`
    Server is running on port: http://localhost:5000

Now go back to the project root and navigate to */flight-booking-frontend*

Try running npm start and you will receive an error message.

Fix all errors and when you can run the frontend aplication from start to finish go to step two.

## Second Task
